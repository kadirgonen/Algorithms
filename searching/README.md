if you know a solution is not from the root node of the tree 
# breadth first search 

if the tree is very deep and solutions are rarely found
# breadth first search (dfs will take long)

if the tree is very wide
# depth first search (bfs will need to much memory)

if solutions are frequent but located in the deep
# depth first search

determining whether a path exists b/w two nodes 
# depth first search

finding the shortest path 
# breadth first search
